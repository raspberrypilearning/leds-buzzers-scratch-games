## Scratch games with LEDs and buzzers

The last thing you're going to do in this project is make a two-player Scratch game.

The game will be a simple race game but the players can only move at certain times indicated by two LEDs and a buzzer. If a player tries to move when the red LED is lit, they will jump backwards!
