This is the **Scratch 3** project and requires a **Raspberry Pi 4**. There is also a [similar project for Scratch 1.4](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/physical-computing-with-scratch14){:target="_blank"} which can be used with earlier Raspberry Pi models.

## Introduction

In this project you will learn how to wire and control LEDs and buzzers as electronic outputs for a Raspberry Pi 4 using the latest version of Scratch. 
You will combine Scratch and physical computing to work with each other to add physical world outputs to on-screen Scratch games.
