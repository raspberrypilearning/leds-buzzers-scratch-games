## Introduction

In this project you will learn how to wire and control LEDs and buzzers as electronic outputs for a Raspberry Pi 4 using the latest version of Scratch. 
You will combine Scratch and physical computing to work with each other to add physical world outputs to on-screen Scratch games.

### What you will make
