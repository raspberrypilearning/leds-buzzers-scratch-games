## Challenge: Light show!

Add more LEDs to your breadboard, connect them to your Pi and code a spectacular light show!

Add new LEDs in the same way that you added the first one.

Connect another LED using the **3.3v** GPIO pin.

If the LED turns on then you know it is working and connected the correct way round, so move the jumper cable from the **3.3v** pin to a numbered GPIO pin.

When the `program starts`{:class="crumblebasic"}, it should `wait`{:class="crumblecontrol"} a couple of seconds and then turn both motors `FORWARD`{:class="crumbleinputoutput"}, then `wait`{:class="crumblecontrol"} until the buggy has travelled about 30cm. Then, the motors should turn right until they have turned 180Â° (a half turn), then both motors should turn `FORWARD`{:class="crumbleinputoutput"} until the buggy is back in its starting position. Then, both motors should `STOP`{:class="crumbleinputoutput"}.

You will need to use the blocks below to create the 'there and back again' code.

Can you rearrange them and alter the wait times to make the code work?

The code below works for the example buggy. You might need to alter the wait times and speeds for your buggy.
