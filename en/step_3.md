## Coding an LED using an GPIO pin

Now you are going to start using the power of the GPIO pins to control the lighting of the LED. 

--- task ---

Move the jumper cable conencted to the **3.3v** pin on the Pi to GPIO pin 17 as shown below.

The LED should not be lit as you have not turned the pin on yet. If it is lit, that's not a problem as you will soon learn how to turn it off.

Now you are going to write code in Scratch to control the LED.

--- task ---

Open up Scratch 3 from your Raspberry Pi menu.
