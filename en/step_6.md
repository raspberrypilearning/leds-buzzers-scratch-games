## Coding sequences

Now you know how to wire up LEDs and buzzers, it is about time we mashed them up together. First let's look at something new about breadboards...

### Breadboard side positive and negative strips

You have been using the horizontal rows of five holes that join your components together but there is also a pair of vertical side strips that are often marked as positive (+) and negative (-) and are usually used to create a positive and negative strip all the way down the side of your breadboard.

Since we are using switched GPIO pins, we have little use for a positive strip but a negative strip connected to the Raspberry Pi ground makes a lot of sense.

### Wriring up

--- task ---

Wire up a couple of LEDs to GPIO 17 and 23, and a buzzer to GPIO 25. Link the negative side strip to the Raspberry Pi ground (GND) pin and take all negative feeds from there.

### Sequence 1

--- task ---

Wire up a couple of LEDs to GPIO 17 and 23, and a buzzer to GPIO 25. Link the negative side strip to the Raspberry Pi ground (GND) pin and take all negative feeds from there.
